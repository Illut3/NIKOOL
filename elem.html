<i><h1> Elementary Days </h1></i>
 <p id="pag1"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp My elementary school years were exciting and enjoyable. It's both challenging and exciting.
Elementary school is full of memorable memories that taught you to appreciate small things.
It was difficult to balance sports and academics, but you will get used to it in the days ahead. Although it is difficult but, to be honest it was so fun meeting new friends from various parts of the Cebu and having a memorable experience. What matters most is that I learned and I am proud to have completed it. 

<br> 
&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Elementary school was kindergarten through fourth grade and there is very little I remember. I don’t remember going home and reading to my grandparents or playing with anyone at recess or biting my nails when I was made to talk in front of my classmates, but I know I did. There are pictures of elementary school me with big smiles and bitten down nails. There’s this memory I have of writing my name in cursive and being told, rather harshly, that I was not to do that again because we were not being taught that. I remember biting my nails and nodding and struggling to remember cursive letters in later years. But I also remember a classmate cutting my finger so bad it was barely hanging on and then going back to class just fine with a band aid on. I don’t know if either is a real memory, but the more I think about it the more I realize that I don’t write in cursive and my finger is doesn’t really matter And also there was time that my friend are being haunted by our room some of my classmates are scared but for for me its was a very satisfying. So me and may classmate collaborating and brainstorming about what happened so what we did is doing some experiment that keep the ghost's away so we made some holy water, garlic and salt so we mixed it after we put it in a bottle spray then we went to our room sprayed it in  the wall we sprayed it the whole room so there are some extra sa amo gi mix we sprayed it to the other rooms so that we can assure that we are safe. That was a memorable experience for me because that time was the only way i can talk with my crush so as time goes by we went to a near bakeshop then i ordered some drinks. Thats it that was the time that happiness can only found through experiment. I don’t have vivid memories of happiness or sadness, but I know they were both there and sometimes I wish I could go back simply so I could know what was concrete, I don’t think any of my memories are true.

So here are the glimpse of my Elementary Days Ps: I only have picture during our provincial days.

 <i> <h1> High School Days</h1></i>
   <p id="pag1">&nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In my high school level, I learned many things from my subjects. It is fun and exciting and meeting new friends. We share jokes and laughter. Sometimes we are being scolded by our teachers due to being very talkative. Sometimes we dont listen to our lesson, sometimes we copy each others assignments and we tease each other. In the first day of my class i am so naughty with that my teacher caught me talking with my seatmates then she confornted me and giving some advice but most of them kay isog na pag ka talk so i was scared that time because maybe she might have a heart atttack caused by his age. I was afraid of it because maybe she will let me out of her class so what i did is I just sit i still remain calm but deep inside im already peeing. I regret of what happened last 2015 I guess.  
    
<br>
  &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspAlthough its been a long time but the trauma is still here. Anyways i have lost of friends since elementary, maybe most of them are my classmate. After 3 months christmas season is near so what we did is to perform a dance with the concept of Chirstmas. It was funny because i did not attended some of the practice so the leader placed me at the back so I just follow the steps but wa jd nagkadimao akon sayaw. Altough  my performance is not good but our performance is still successfull. Dec 20  guess we had our chirstmass party we shared our boan and then we exchanged gifts. Later on i met this teacher named Lou Ann she was very kind and loving teacher she understands and accepts of whay i am. So  with change for that i help her with her plants, cleaning he classroom and more. Even i am too naughty Ms. Lou ann still accepts me and the was the first teacher i admire like she was my inspiration. I want all teachers be like her. Because some of the teacher misjudge the students by looking at their physical appreance they didint look at thier inner self. We should also consider their emotions some of the teacher always mad with their students without knowing their experiences or what they went trhough. Anyways it was a rollercoaster ride full of learnings and memories.

<i><h1> Senior High Days</h1></i>
 <p id="pag1"> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbspThis is how my senior high school life started , first day of school. I felt excited and nervous. Excited in such a way that I will be able to experience another journey of my life. Nervous in the sense that I will be facing new classmates , new teachers and new friends . Nevertheless , the nervous I felt in the first day slowly gone and filled with happiness. I was able to gained new friends . Most of them are my schoolmate and some of them are transferees from other school. I really thought that my senior high school would be very boring ,but I was wrong.  I don’t expect that I would be enjoying with my new friends and my classmates. I really treasure every single days with them , with their craziness in life. 

<br>
 &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp As the days passed by, I experienced lots of new things in my life . I was able to eat with my classmates and teacher in what we called “bodol fight”. You’ll be eating with your bare hands only ,no using using of spoons and forks. The foods are placed together in a big banana leaves. I really enjoy eating with themIn my Senior days i am being bullied by my fellow students because of my teeth it was so destructive ive lost my confidence in talking to other people but then met my friends and with that their were so good to me they cheer me up through my downs. I knwo being bullied has a big impact to us it gives us trauma but one thng I learned during my senior days is to not pay attention just have fun and make your senior day memorable and gladly i made it i completed and i am so proud of it even there are some barriers you still succeed and you strive.
